<p><em>A torn entry, found in the field journal of an unnamed soldier. Handwriting steady. The ink hesitates.</em></p>

<p>No more orders. No more drills. No more <del>names to remember</del> maps to burn.</p>

<p>I came because I couldn’t stop hearing them.
Boots.
Steel.
<del>Screams.</del> Voices that belonged to men who didn’t come back.
My name among them.</p>

<p>Hollow Vale did not judge me.
The fog thickened, and they were there —
<del>Bleeding. Broken.</del>
Standing. Silent. Watching.</p>

<p>I found the altar. The one from the dreams.
A slab of stone where a sword should end.
I placed mine there.
<del>Buried it.</del> Let it rest.
It felt like an exhale I had forgotten how to take.</p>

<p>The veil moved.
I think… I think they nodded.</p>

<p><del>I don’t deserve peace.</del>
I walked forward anyway.</p>

<p>The sword stayed.
The ghosts did not follow.
My back didn’t ache when I stood up.
<del>That scared me more than anything.</del></p>

<p>Let this be the last page.
<del>Let me forget.</del>
Let me be something more than the blade.</p>

<p>— R.</p>
