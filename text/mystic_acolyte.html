<p><em>A page pressed between dried leaves and bound with a silken thread. The ink shimmers faintly when touched.
The hand that wrote it is steady, though the letters seem older than the page.</em></p>

<p>I do not mark time as others do.
There was a beginning, once. A veil. A clearing. A question.</p>

<p>The spirit came to me when the stars were still.
Childlike in shape, but older than memory.
It did not speak.
It didn’t need to.</p>

<p>It watched me kneel.
It watched the dew form around my robes.
And then the clearing… breathed.</p>

<p>I do not remember parting the veil.
Only the feeling of it parting me.</p>

<p>Visions passed like light through water.
Unknowable. Unwritten.
I tried to hold them, but they passed through my palms like wind.
Not to be kept — only witnessed.</p>

<p>When it was over, I remained.
The spirit was gone, but not lost.
Its echo lingers in the trees — not as voice, but as shimmer.
A reminder that I am no longer waiting.</p>

<p>The others may seek answers. Closure. Rest.
I carry only silence now.
And in silence, I understand more than ever.</p>

<p><strong>The veil is gone.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The path is not.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>I walk it still.</em></strong></p>
