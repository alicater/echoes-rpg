<p><em>A short story from the journals of the Wayward Scholar</em></p>

<p>The fog welcomed me like an old colleague—obscuring all but what I sought. Hollow Vale was quiet, 
its wooden beams bowed with age, its villagers draped in worry. Whispers chased my footsteps, 
but I had not come for gossip. I had come for the breach.</p>

<p>The elder met me at the village center, his eyes like dried ink—hollowed, spent.
"You’re the one they sent?" he asked, more to the wind than to me.
"I was not sent," I replied. "I followed the glyphs."</p>

<p>He handed me a key. Not to a door, but to a place that hadn't existed for centuries. 
Beneath the roots of the Vale, hidden in stone and silence, I found it: The Scriptorium of Verisyl.</p>

<p>Its seal pulsed as I approached, reacting to the resonance of my breath. The glyphs had changed since I last studied them. Four rings. Four numbers. The old tongue whispered again.
"Two... one... three... four.”</p>

<p>The ward dissolved.</p>

<p>Inside, the air shimmered with knowledge long denied. Books unread. Languages unborn. 
And in the center, a tome that hummed when I neared.</p>

<p>I opened it.</p>

<p>Ink bled from the pages, not onto them. Symbols rose, turned, split like cells. 
They reached into my mind, into memories I hadn't written. I saw the veil. I saw both sides. 
I saw what would happen if it tore further.</p>

<p>I should have left it there. But scholars rarely leave questions unanswered.</p>

<p>When I emerged, the fog was gone.</p>

<p>The village was quiet again—not relieved, but emptied. Whether I had sealed the breach or simply 
rewritten its terms, I do not know. My fingers still twitch with language I can’t speak aloud. 
I dream in blue now. I hear ink dripping even when the quill is dry.</p>

<p>But I know this: the veil remembers me.</p>

<p>And someday, it will want its words back.</p>
