<p><em>A page tucked between loose stones in a forgotten wall. No name. Just a faint fox sigil drawn in the corner, glowing briefly before fading.</em></p>

<p>They always say the Vale is cursed.
I never cared for curses. But secrets? Secrets are worth the risk.</p>

<p>The crypt wasn’t on any map. That’s how I knew it was real.</p>

<p>Stone slick with moss. Tombs cracked open like clams.
And there, near the back — a chest. Locked, of course. Whispering, almost.
The kind of lock that remembers the last hands that touched it.</p>

<p>It opened too easily.</p>

<p>Inside, a crystal pulsing soft purple. Warm, like breath.
When I lifted it, it spoke. Not in words — in memory.
I saw shadows moving. Mine. Others.
Something clever in me stirred. Something afraid, too.</p>

<p>Behind me, something shifted on the wall.
A shape — not quite a person. Not quite gone.
I didn’t turn around.</p>

<p>Instead, I laughed. Quietly.
I always knew I wasn’t alone down here.</p>

<p>The sigil on the floor — a fox, etched cleaner than the rest — began to glow.
I touched it once, and it vanished.
Not a warning. A signature.</p>

<p>I left the way I came.
No relics. No treasure.
Just the knowledge that someone had been waiting for me to find them.
And that I did.</p>

<p>Let them echo.</p>

<p>Let them wonder.</p>

<p>The trail’s already gone cold.</p>
